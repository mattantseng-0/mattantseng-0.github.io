# Negative Friction Pendulum

## Theory

### Simple Pendulum Motion
When a pendulum is at rest, the tension of the rod and the weight of the pendulum are in direct opposition resulting in a static system (Fig. \ref{fig:static_pendulum}). When, however, the pendulum is raised to one side and then released, the weight of the pendulum creates a moment about the origin of the pendulum resulting in angular motion (Fig. \ref{fig:raised_pendulum}).

        \caption{Raised Pendulum with Component Vectors}
        \label{fig:raised_pendulum}

    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}



Mathematically, we can describe this behavior with Newton's Second Law (Eq. \ref{eq:angular_acceleration})

$$
    \tau = I\ddot{\theta}
    \label{eq:angular_acceleration}
$$

\begin{center}
\textit{I = mass moment of inertia, $\ddot{\theta}$ = angular acceleration}
\end{center}

Using (Eq. \ref{eq:angular_acceleration}) and Fig. \ref{fig:raised_pendulum}, we can determine the sum of moments about the origin. While there is a term for $\tau_{applied}$ in the equation, we will ignore it for now and assume it is zero.

$$
    \sum \tau_o = mgLsin(\theta) + \tau_{applied} = I\ddot{\theta}
    \label{eq:sum_moments}
$$ 
\begin{center}
\textit{$\theta$ = angle of pendulum, m = mass of pendulum, g = gravity, L = length of pendulum, $\tau_{applied}$ = external torque applied to pendulum}
\end{center}

Based on (Eq. \ref{eq:sum_moments}) we can show the behavior of a simple pendulum (Fig. \ref{fig:Undamped_motion}). Notice that without friction, the perturbed pendulum will swing forever.

### Friction on the Pendulum

In the real world world where friction exists, an additional element in terms of angular velocity ($\dot{\theta}$) must be included. The following equation (Eq. \ref{eq:sum_moments_friction}) can be used to calculate the motion of a pendulum with friction. 

\newpage
$$
    mgLsin(\theta) - \beta \dot{\theta} + \tau_{applied} = I\ddot{\theta}
    \label{eq:sum_moments_friction}
$$
\begin{center}
    \textit{$\beta$ = friction coeffecient}
\end{center}

Using this equation, we can start to categorize the behavior of the pendulum based on the magnitude of the coeffecient of friction, $\beta$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{damping_behavior.png}
    \caption{Undamped, Underdamped, Overdamped Behavior}
    \label{fig:damping_behavior}
\end{figure}

Based on Fig. \ref{fig:damping_behavior} we can see that increasing the friction causes damping behavior in the pendulum. A larger coefficient of friction causes the pendulum to converge to the fixed point faster. If a positive coefficient of friction results in decaying behavior, it's easy to see how a negative coefficient of friction should result in growth in the pendulum's swing. This concept is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:negative_friction} by using a coefficient of friction with a negative sign. For the switched pendulum, negative friction creates the stretching mechanism.

    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{negative_friction.png}
    \caption{Pendulum Behavior with Negative Friction}
    \label{fig:negative_friction}
\end{figure}


It should be noted that in Fig. \ref{fig:negative_friction} when the pendulum crosses $\theta = \pi$, the growth explodes exponentially. $\theta = \pi$ corresponds with the pendulum going over the top, at which point it begins spinning uncontrollably.

## Real World Implementation


### Negative Resistors and Negative Friction

The equation for rotational power is: 

$$
    P = \tau \omega = \tau \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
\begin{center}
    \textit{P = power, $\tau$ = torque, $\omega$ = angular velocity}
\end{center}

The equation for electrical power is: 

$$
    P = iV
$$

Ohm's law states: 

$$
    V = iR
$$

If we consider a motor/generator as a converter between mechanical power to electrical power, then we can say for an ideal generator: 

$$
    P_{mechanical} = P_{electrical}
$$

$$
    \tau_{friction} \frac{d\theta}{dt} = iV
$$

Use Ohm's law to relate the resistor to the applied torque:

$$
    \tau_{friction} \frac{d\theta}{dt} = i^2R
    \label{eq:Mpower_to_Epower}
$$

To maintain equilibrium, when R is increased, the $\tau_{friction}$ must also be increased to maintain the same rotational velocity: it's harder to spin the motor when the resistance is greater. 

With Eq. \ref{eq:Mpower_to_Epower}, we can see that attaching a positive resistor to the motor results in an \textit{increased} amount of friction, and attaching a negative resistor to the motor would \textit{decrease} the friction. While there is no passive component that behaves as a negative resistor, the negative impedance converter \cite{horowitz_art_2021} (Fig. \ref{fig:negative_impedance_converter}) is an active circuit that is effectively a negative resistor. With the negative impedance converter, voltage potential created by the motor's back emf results in current being supplied to the motor 
\footnote{The concept of negative resistance and negative friction is sometimes slippery to understand because it's not a naturally occurring phenomenon. The reader may find the following example helpful as a way of visualizing the behavior of a negative resistor. The mechanical analog to a resistor is a spring. As outlined in Eq. \ref{eq:spring}, compressing a spring results in an opposing force proportional to the spring's modulus of elasticity: the spring resists changes in length.   

$$
    F = K\Delta X
    \label{eq:spring}
$$

Having a negative spring in the real world, would be a spring with a \textit{negative} modulus of elasticity. Functionally, this would mean that a person attempting to compress the spring would have their hand pulled by the spring and the spring would compress even farther: the negative spring would assist in its own compression.}.

To solve for the resistance of the negative impedance converter, assume $v_{in} = v_2$.


$$
    v_1 = v_{in} - R_1i_{in}
$$

$$
    v_{in} = v_1(\frac{R_3}{R_2 + R_3})
$$


$$
    v_{in} = (v_{in} - R_1i_{in})(\frac{R_3}{R_2 + R_3})
$$

$$
    v_{in}(1- \frac{R_3}{R_2 + R_3}) = -\frac{R_3R_1i_{in}}{R_2 + R_3}
$$

$$
    v_{in} = -\frac{R_3R_1}{R_2}i_{in}
$$

Notice that this takes the form of Ohms law, but the resistance term has a negative sign.
